<span style="color:red">**MenuMaps**</span> is a web application project that uses restaurant/dish curation and maps to empower people who may have felt restricted in their diets to expand and experience foreign cuisines and support businesses near them. 

MenuMap caters to a diverse user base, from students on a budget to adventurous eaters looking for a great recommendation. The app will take inputs from the user such as desired price range, type of cuisine and dietary restrictions to filter nearby restaurants and display the choices on an interactive map.
